## Dotted: Transforming Digital Media into Braille
Dotted is a BraillePad designed to make digital content accessible to everyone. It allows users to convert digital media into braille effortlessly, creating a seamless experience for individuals with visual impairments. By combining simplicity and technology, Dotted bridges the gap between the digital and tactile worlds, making information more accessible and empowering users to engage with digital content in meaningful ways.<br>  
## Our Mission and Vision<br>
At Dotted, our goal is simple: to make the digital world accessible to everyone, including those with visual impairments. We work towards inclusivity and independence by creating easy-to-use solutions for the visually impaired community. Our vision is a world where anyone, regardless of their abilities, can effortlessly read and interact with digital content using braille. We strive to make this vision a reality, ensuring that no one is left behind in the digital age. <br>

## Tech Stack
We have both a hardware machine prototype that helps convert digital media to tactile dots that can be read by the visually impaired and also a website that serves as a platform for us to showcase our product to the world.<br>
The hardware has been covered in the presentation and as for the website, the Tech Stack is mainly React.js along with Bootstrap and FontAwesome for external styling. We do not have a backend as of now since our main focus is the prototype and hence, it's a purely front-end based application.
